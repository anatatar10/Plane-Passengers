This Python project is a streamlined airport management system designed to efficiently handle planes and passengers through a console-based user interface. The testing is done by the Unittest framework. It supports comprehensive CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations. Key features include advanced sorting capabilities, allowing users to organize data based on various criteria easily. The architecture is layered, clearly separating concerns across domain definition, data management, application logic, and user interface presentation. With an emphasis on usability, the console UI guides users through a menu-driven approach to perform operations, from adding new entries to sorting and retrieving data.
